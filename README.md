youtube intelect

I built this Python tool to analyze YouTube comments and uncover what viewers really think. Using machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, it classifies comments as positive, negative, or neutral. The tool also includes data preprocessing, text analysis, and visualizations to help content creators understand their audience and make informed decisions.
